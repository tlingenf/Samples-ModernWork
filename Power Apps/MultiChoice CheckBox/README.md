There are 3 samples in this application
1. Basic Control Example
2. Component Example
3. Form Example

## Setup
First, you will need to create a new SharePoint list in which you will build out your sample content. Add a multi-choice column and make sure to name it **ChoiceCol**. The sample app does not provide a way to create new list items, only update existin list items. I recommend that you create two sample items in your list.

Next, go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), select your desired environment, open solutions in the left rail, and import the solution [MultiChoiceCheckboxes_1_0_0_1.zip](MultiChoiceCheckboxes_1_0_0_1.zip). During solution import, you will be prompted to select or create a new SharePoint connection. You will then be prompted to provide values for 2 environment variables. 

* SharePoint Check Box Site - Select the site from the drop down or paste the site URL.
* SharePoint Check Box List - Once the site is populated, you can select the list you created in the drop down.

## Using the Sample App

To view how the app was constructed it is best to open the app in Edit mode so that you can inspect the various formulas. However, each sample has an overview of the settings to create the sample as text on the screen.
